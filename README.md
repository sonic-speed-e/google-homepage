This project will consist of deconstructing an existing web page and rebuilding it.

The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on a page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.

This is my first time building a page with The Odin Project.

This is also my first time building a page taking advantage of developer tools.

Here is the link to the project details:
